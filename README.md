## ðŸš€ Techs

Expense Manager API was developed with these technologies:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/)
- [Serverless Framework](https://www.serverless.com/)
- [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Zod](https://zod.dev/)

## ðŸ’» Project

This project is a serverless application with five lambda functions, designed to manage expenses using a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) interface with DynamoDB as the data store, as described above:

The developed functions are the following:

- **getExpenses lambda function**:
  - Exposes an HTTP GET endpoint at /expenses via API Gateway.
  - Retrieves all expense records from the DynamoDB table.
  - Returns a list of expenses in JSON format.

- **getExpenseById lambda function**:
  - Exposes an HTTP GET endpoint at /expenses/{id} via API Gateway.
  - Validates incoming payloads to ensure data integrity.
  - Retrieves a specific expense record from the DynamoDB table based on the provided id.

- **createExpense lambda function**:
  - Exposes an HTTP POST endpoint at /expenses via API Gateway.
  - Validates incoming payloads to ensure data integrity.
  - Creates a new expense record in the DynamoDB table.

- **updateExpenseById lambda function**:
  - Exposes an HTTP PUT endpoint at /expenses via API Gateway.
  - Validates incoming payloads to ensure data integrity.
  - Updates the specified expense record in the DynamoDB table based on the provided id.

- **deleteExpenseById lambda function**:
  - Exposes an HTTP DELETE endpoint at /expenses/{id} via API Gateway.
  - Validates incoming payloads to ensure data integrity.
  - Deletes the specified expense record from the DynamoDB table based on the provided id.

We can see the following preview on aws console lambdas after deploy:
